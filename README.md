# Vu Anh Homepage

Hello World,

My name is Vu Anh. I'm a developer working at a startup in Hanoi, Vietnam. Coding and writing is fun, so I make this site to share my gists about computer science, data science, and more. It helps me keep my hobby and save information in case I forget. I wish it will be useful for you too.

PS: I always looking for collaboration. Feel free to contact me via email anhv.ict91[at]gmail.com

# My Stories



Oct 2, 2016: Wow. It's 524th day of my journey. I added some notes in README.md, index.html, changed structure of website. Today I feel like at begin day when I start writing at datayo.wordpress.com blog. In this pass, there are times when I want to make a professional website like tutorialpoints but it doesn't work that way. Because in my heart, I don't want it, I don't to make a professional website. I just love coding, writing and sharing my hobby with people around the world. So today I come back to starting point, I will keep my writing schedule, make some fun stuffs each week.

In July 2016, I turn to use HTML and mkdocs, and opensource `magizbox`.

In March 2015, I start writing blog with wordpress.
